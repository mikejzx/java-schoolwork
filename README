===============

This repository contains my 2021 Java school work for a Software Development.

All the practicals and tasks are Makefile-based. Simply run `make` in any of
the directories to compile and run the program in that directory. `make` should
be pre-installed on most Linux distributions. Win$hit users will have to
compile the programs through other means, or install the MinGW version of make.
